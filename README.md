# Simple LoRa SX1276 Communication (MicroPython)

This project demonstrates a minimal **point-to-point communication** setup using the **SX1276 LoRa radio modem** with **ESP32 boards running MicroPython**.  
It is inspired by [winniebinnie/SX1276](https://github.com/winniebinnie/SX1276), but simplified for easy testing.

---

## üìÇ Files
- `lora.py` ‚Äì LoRa driver (SX1276 wrapper for MicroPython)
- `sender.py` ‚Äì sends test messages every few seconds
- `receiver.py` ‚Äì listens for incoming packets and prints them

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup
- **MCU**: ESP32 (tested with MicroPython firmware)
- **LoRa chip**: SX1276 (e.g., HopeRF RFM95 or Murata 1SJ)
- **Connections** (adjust pins as needed in `lora.py`):
  - MISO ‚Üí GPIO19  
  - MOSI ‚Üí GPIO23  
  - SCK ‚Üí GPIO18  
  - CS   ‚Üí GPIO5  
  - RST  ‚Üí GPIO17  
  - DIO0 ‚Üí GPIO26  

Make sure both sender and receiver are wired identically.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
1. Flash MicroPython to ESP32.  
2. Upload `lora.py`, `sender.py`, and `receiver.py` to each board.  
3. On **MCU #1** run:
   ```bash
   mpremote connect COM3 run sender.py
````

4. On **MCU #2** run:

   ```bash
   mpremote connect COM4 run receiver.py
   ```

The receiver should start printing the messages sent from the sender.

## üìù Notes

* Default frequency is **868 MHz** (change if needed in `lora.py`).
* Data rate and spreading factor are kept simple for demo purposes.
* This is intended for **learning and testing**. For production, consider adding:

  * Error checking (CRC/ACK)
  * Encryption
  * Dynamic key exchange

Do you want me to also **include the sender.py and receiver.py code inline in the README** (so you can copy from one file), or keep it separate as you already have?
